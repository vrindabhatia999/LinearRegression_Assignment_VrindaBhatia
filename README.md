# Linear Regression Bike Case Study
> Required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.


## Table of Contents
* [General Info]: To make models for bike data analysis, model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
* [Technologies Used]: Python libraries: numpy,pandas, Visulisation libraries: matplotlib,seaborn 
* [Conclusions](#conclusions): Based on the model, the variables which are influencing the bike bookings are temperature, year, season, weather.

## Conclusions
 
<span>
<p><b>Based on the model, the variables which are influencing the bike bookings are: </b></p>
        <br>
<li><b>Temperature (Temp)</b><br> It is evident from the model that customers prefer warm and pleasant temperature for bike booking </li>
<br>
<li><b>Year</b><br> There was significant rise in bike booking in 2019 compared to 2018. It is expected that during post-Covid people will avail this service rather travelling in crowded buses and trains </li>
<br>
<li><b> Season </b><br>It seems that customers prefered Summer and Fall season, hence, a good number of bikes should be available during this time.</li>
<br>
<li><b> Weather </b><br>It seems that customers avoided renting bikes during light snow and rain and preferred clear and cloudy weather</li>

# Recommendations to increase sales
    
    
    

<br>


<li><b>Frequent Sanitisation of Bikes</b>
    <br>
    Frequent Sanitisation of the Bikes and indicating the same in the booking app will help in building the trust between the customer and company
    </li>
    <br>

<li><b>Providing discounts and better deals</b><br>During rainy seasons, BoomBike should offer deals and discounts to attaract more customers.</li>
<br>

<li><b> Rain Covers or Umbrellas </b><br>Attached umbrellas or rain protective gears with bikes may attract more customers during rainy season</li><br>
